# Documentation for the Response to Reviewers LaTeX Template

This document provides detailed instructions for using the LaTeX template designed for preparing responses to reviewers during the peer-review process of academic publications. The template includes custom commands and environments to facilitate clear and organized communication with reviewers and editors.

## License

The template is released under the BSD 3-Clause License. Please refer to the license text included at the top of the template for details.

## Template Overview

The template provides a structured format for responding to reviewers' comments. It includes environments for quoting reviewer comments, quoting excerpts from your own paper, and quoting external sources. It also includes custom commands for annotations and alerts to help you manage revisions.

## Usage Instructions

### Environment Definitions

#### `revquote`

The `revquote` environment is used to display reviewer comments in a shaded box with a specific style.

```latex
\begin{revquote}
[Insert reviewer comment here.]
\end{revquote}
```

#### `quotepaper`

The `quotepaper` environment is used to quote excerpts from your own paper, either the old or revised version.

```latex
\begin{quotepaper}
[Insert excerpt from your paper here.]
\end{quotepaper}
```

#### `externalquote`

The `externalquote` environment is used to quote excerpts from external sources. It supports optional alignment and author attribution.

```latex
\begin{externalquote}[alignment]{Author Name}
[Insert external quote here.]
\end{externalquote}
```

**Parameters:**
- `alignment` (optional): Alignment of the text and author attribution. Options are `l` (left), `c` (center), `r` (right). Default is `l`.
- `Author Name` (optional): Name of the author to attribute the quote to.

**Example:**

```latex
\begin{externalquote}[c]{Smith and Jones}
Artificial intelligence is the new electricity, revolutionizing industries, transforming economies, and shaping the future of human progress.
\end{externalquote}
```

### Custom Commands

#### `\alert{...}`

The `\alert{}` command is used to highlight important notes or alerts within the text.

```latex
\alert{This is an important note.}
```

#### `\qo` (from lat. *quaestio*= question)

The `\qo` command inserts a highlighted question mark, used as a reminder to verify section or reference numbers before final submission.

```latex
As mentioned in Section~\qo\ref{sec:method}, we have updated the algorithm.
```

#### `\io` (from lat. *inspicio* = inspect)

The `\io` command inserts an alert symbol, indicating that a promised change has not yet been implemented in the paper.

```latex
We updated the figure in the next revision.\io
```

### Annotations

The template includes commands for internal annotations, which can be helpful during the revision process. These annotations are meant to be removed before the final submission.

#### `\Mehdi{...}`

Used to insert a comment or note from Mehdi (add/replace with a version with your name).

```latex
\Mehdi{This section needs to be expanded with more details.}
```

#### `\ToBeDone`

Used as a placeholder to indicate that a section or task is yet to be completed.

```latex
\ToBeDone
```


#### `\MehdiOK`

The `\MehdiOK` command is used to indicate that a task or section has been reviewed and approved by Mehdi (add/replace with a version with your name). It displays a checkmark icon with highlighting.


### Examples

#### Responding to a Reviewer Comment

```latex
\subsubsection{Comment on Methodology}
\begin{revquote}
The methodology section lacks detail on the data preprocessing steps.
\end{revquote}

Thank you for pointing this out. We have expanded the methodology section to include detailed descriptions of the data preprocessing steps.

As stated in the revised manuscript:

\begin{quotepaper}
We have added a new subsection detailing the data normalization and augmentation techniques used in our experiments.
\end{quotepaper}
```

#### Quoting an External Source

```latex
In support of our approach, we refer to the work by Doe and Smith:

\begin{externalquote}[r]{Doe and Smith}
"Machine learning algorithms have the potential to uncover patterns in data that are not apparent to humans."
\end{externalquote}
```

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the template by adjusting the color definitions and environment settings in the preamble. For example, to change the background color of the `revquote` environment, modify the `colback` parameter in its definition.
